# Collatz-conjecture
This repository contains my first ever programm. 
I like maths and some time ago i learned about the collatz conjecture,
i was fascinated by this mathematical conjecture and decided to use my new programming skills to develop a programm that calculates the path of a given number under the rules of the collatz conjecture. I will soon update the code of the programm and i will soon add to this repository more informations about its functionalities!

#This repository will only contain the python file
